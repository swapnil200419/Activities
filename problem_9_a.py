Icebraker Exercise
Problem -I The wavelength of visible light ranges from 380 to 750 nanometers (nm). While the spectrum is continuous, it is often divided into 6 colors as shown below:
Violet 380 to less than 450 Blue 450 to less than 495 Green 495 to less than 570 Yellow 570 to less than 590 Orange 590 to less than 620 Red 620 to 750
Write a program that reads a wavelength from the user and reports its color. Display an appropriate error message if the wavelength entered by the user is outside of the visible spectrum.
