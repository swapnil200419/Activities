Suppose you are buying something online on amazon.com
On the website, you get a 15% discount if you are a prime member. Additionally, you are also getting a discount of 8% on the item because it's black Friday sales.
Write a function that takes as input the amount of the asset that you are buying and a logical variable indicating whether you are a prime member applies the discount offered appropriately and returns the result.
